            <div class="content-card">
                <p>I'm Vincent Mizhquiri, a talent acquisition professional with over 10 years of experience connecting exceptional people with transformative opportunities. Based in New York, I've built my career helping Fortune 500 companies and innovative startups across financial services, fintech, healthcare, eCommerce, and government sectors find the talent that drives their success.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout my career, I've filled hundreds of roles spanning software engineering, data science, cloud architecture, AI/ML, UX/UI design, risk management, and corporate leadership. What sets me apart is my ability to deliver results: I've consistently reduced time-to-hire by 20-25% while maintaining offer acceptance rates above 85%. At InRhythm, I filled over 110 technical and leadership roles annually while leading and mentoring a team of recruiters. At iCapital, I achieved a 90% offer acceptance rate by balancing market intelligence with strategic negotiation.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond recruiting, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to enhance business operations. I'm currently participating in Pursuit's competitive AI-Native program, where I'm exploring how emerging AI tools can streamline workflows, improve process accuracy, and support data-driven decision-making. This commitment to continuous learning reflects my belief that the best talent professionals stay ahead of industry trends.</p>
                
                <p>My approach combines technical expertise with genuine human connection. Whether I'm sourcing candidates through Boolean searches on GitHub, optimizing ATS dashboards in Greenhouse, or partnering with DE&I organizations to build diverse talent pipelines, I focus on creating equitable, efficient processes that benefit both candidates and organizations.</p>
                
                <p>I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with a concentration in Industrial-Organizational Psychology from Queens College, CUNY, and I'm fluent in Spanish. When I'm not recruiting or exploring AI applications, I manage operations for family-owned properties in Brooklyn, where I've honed skills in vendor negotiation, budgeting, and stakeholder communication.</p>
                
                <p>Let's connect—whether you're looking to build your team or explore new opportunities, I'm always excited to have meaningful conversations about talent, technology, and the future of work.</p>
