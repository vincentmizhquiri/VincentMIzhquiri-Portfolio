# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/vincentmizhquiri/VincentMIzhquiri-Portfolio

2. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click on the "Settings" tab (top right of your repository)

3. **Find Pages Section:**
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar

4. **Configure Source:**
   - Under "Source", select:
     - Branch: `main`
     - Folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click "Save"

5. **Wait for Deployment:**
   - GitHub Pages can take 1-10 minutes to deploy
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

6. **Access Your Site:**
   - Your site will be available at:
   - `https://vincentmizhquiri.github.io/VincentMIzhquiri-Portfolio/`

## Important Notes:

⚠️ **Your HTML references `styles.css` and `script.js` which don't exist yet!**
- The page will load but won't have styling or JavaScript functionality
- You'll need to create these files or remove the references

## Troubleshooting:

- If the site shows a 404 error, wait a few minutes and refresh
- Make sure your repository is **public** (private repos need GitHub Pro)
- Check that `index.html` is in the root directory (it is ✓)
- Clear your browser cache or try incognito mode
